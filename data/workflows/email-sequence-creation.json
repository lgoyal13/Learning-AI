  "whyItMatters": "Email sequences are the workhorse of marketing automation. They nurture leads while you sleep, convert at scale, and build relationships over time. Good sequences can 2-3x conversion rates compared to single emails.",

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Too many emails too fast - respect inbox attention",
    "No clear value in each email - every email should stand alone",
    "Weak subject lines - if they don't open, the content doesn't matter",
    "Generic CTAs - be specific about the next step",
    "No personalization - use merge fields and segmentation"
  ],

  "tips": [
    "Use AI to generate the full sequence at once - maintains narrative thread",
    "Generate 5+ subject lines per email and A/B test the best",
    "Ask AI to write emails that 'build on the previous email's value'",
    "Include a plain-text version - some audiences prefer it"
