  "whyItMatters": "Campaigns drive revenue and brand awareness. A well-planned campaign maximizes ROI and builds brand equity. A poorly planned one wastes budget and damages brand perception.",

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Too many objectives - focus on 1-2 primary goals",
    "Skipping audience research - leads to generic messaging",
    "Underestimating timeline - campaigns always take longer than expected",
    "Not having clear KPIs - makes optimization impossible",
    "Launching without QA - broken tracking ruins measurement"
