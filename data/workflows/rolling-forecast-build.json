  "whyItMatters": "Rolling forecasts provide continuous forward visibility, replacing static annual budgets with dynamic planning. They enable faster reallocation of resources and reduce the 'budget game' where actuals are always compared to outdated plans.",

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Updating numbers without updating assumptions - creates inconsistency",
    "Treating forecast as 'budget 2.0' - it should reflect current best estimate, not targets",
    "Not documenting assumption changes - makes variance analysis impossible",
    "Building scenarios that aren't internally consistent",
    "Over-engineering the model - simpler models are easier to update"
  ],

  "tips": [
    "Use AI to identify which assumptions drive the most variance",
    "Ask AI to pressure-test your assumptions: 'What would need to be true for this forecast?'",
    "Create a standard assumption collection template - consistency speeds the process",
