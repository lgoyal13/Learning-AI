  "whyItMatters": "Executive dashboards drive organizational visibility and accountability. A poorly designed dashboard leads to wrong decisions, wasted engineering effort, and loss of executive trust. Good dashboards (like BigQuery pipelines at AAA) can save thousands of hours.",

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Too many metrics - executives want 5-10 KPIs, not 50 data points",
    "Building before specifying - rushing to code without clear requirements",
    "Ignoring data quality - garbage in, garbage out",
    "No owner - dashboards without maintenance become stale and ignored",
    "Wrong level of detail - executives want trends and exceptions, not raw data"
  ],

  "tips": [
    "Start with 'what decisions will this dashboard inform?' not 'what data do we have?'",
    "Use AI to generate metric definitions - ensures consistency and clarity",
    "Ask AI to critique your dashboard design: 'What's confusing about this layout?'",
