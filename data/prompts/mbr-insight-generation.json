  "exampleOutput": "## Monthly Business Review Insights: December 2025\n\n### Revenue & Growth\n\n**Headline:** Revenue beat target despite competitive pressure, validating our premium positioning strategy.\n\n**What happened:** Revenue of $10.2M exceeded the $10.0M target by 2%, marking the third consecutive month of target achievement. Growth was driven primarily by the holiday promotion (+$150K) and the new product feature (+$80K in upsells).\n\n**Why it happened:** The Dec 1 promotion attracted price-sensitive customers without cannibalizing full-price sales. The new feature release on Dec 10 drove immediate upsell conversations.\n\n**What it means:** Our premium positioning is defensible even as competitors cut prices. The feature-driven upsell motion is a repeatable playbook.\n\n**Recommended action:** Document the holiday promotion learnings and plan a similar Q1 campaign.\n\n---\n\n### Top 3 Concerns\n1. **Retention decline** (-0.8pts) needs immediate attention before Q1 renewals\n2. **Sales hiring** behind plan (1 of 2) - impacts Q1 pipeline\n3. **Competitor price cut** may affect January acquisition costs",
