  "systemPrompt": "You are a strategic planning expert who has helped dozens of companies implement OKRs. You understand the difference between objectives (qualitative, inspirational) and key results (quantitative, measurable). You know that good OKRs are ambitious but not impossible - typically 60-70% achievable.",

  "promptTemplate": "Help me develop OKR alternatives for [DEPARTMENT/TEAM] for [TIME PERIOD].\n\n**Strategic Context:**\n- Company priorities: [LIST TOP 3-5 COMPANY PRIORITIES]\n- Department mission: [WHAT THIS TEAM EXISTS TO DO]\n- Current challenges: [KEY PROBLEMS TO SOLVE]\n- Resources/constraints: [BUDGET, HEADCOUNT, DEPENDENCIES]\n\n**Prior Period Performance:**\n[PASTE SUMMARY FROM STEP 1 - what was achieved, what was missed, lessons learned]\n\n**Benchmark Data:**\n[PASTE RELEVANT BENCHMARKS FROM STEP 2]\n\n**Stakeholder Input:**\n- CEO wants: [SUMMARIZE]\n- CFO wants: [SUMMARIZE]\n- Other key stakeholders: [SUMMARIZE]\n\nPlease generate 3 OKR framework alternatives:\n\n**OPTION A: Conservative** (90% confidence of achievement)\n- 2-3 objectives with 3-4 key results each\n- Focus on foundational improvements and sure wins\n\n**OPTION B: Balanced** (70% confidence - recommended)\n- 2-3 objectives with 3-4 key results each\n- Mix of achievable and stretch targets\n\n**OPTION C: Ambitious** (50% confidence)\n- 2-3 objectives with 3-4 key results each\n- Transformational goals that would be impressive if achieved\n\nFor each option, include:\n1. The objectives and key results\n2. Why this approach makes sense\n3. What would need to go right to achieve it\n4. Key risks or dependencies\n5. How it connects to company priorities",

    "persona": "Strategic planning expert with OKR implementation experience",
    "context": "Quarterly/annual planning cycle; need to balance ambition with achievability; multiple stakeholder priorities to reconcile",
    "task": "Generate three distinct OKR framework options (conservative, balanced, ambitious) with rationale and risk assessment",
    "requirements": [
      "Each option must have 2-3 objectives with 3-4 key results",
      "Key results must be quantifiable (numbers, percentages, dates)",
      "Include confidence level and rationale for each option",
      "Connect to stated company priorities",
      "Flag dependencies and risks"

  "whenToUse": "After you've analyzed historical performance and gathered benchmark data. Use when you need to present options to stakeholders rather than a single recommendation.",

  "commonMistakes": [
    "Not providing enough strategic context - AI will generate generic OKRs",
    "Asking for too many objectives (stick to 2-3 per option)",
    "Accepting key results that aren't truly measurable",
    "Ignoring the 'ambitious' option - sometimes stakeholders want to be pushed"
