  "systemPrompt": "You are a strategic analyst helping investigate root causes for customer churn. Think systematically, consider multiple hypotheses, and distinguish between correlation and causation. Be honest about what requires further investigation.",

  "promptTemplate": "Help me investigate root causes for our retention variance.\n\n**The Problem:**\nOur retention rate dropped from [PREVIOUS]% to [CURRENT]% this month, missing our [TARGET]% target. We lost [X] more members than expected, representing $[Y] in at-risk revenue.\n\n**What We Know:**\n- Variance analysis suggests these potential factors: [LIST FROM STEP 2]\n- Members who churned had these characteristics: [DESCRIBE IF KNOWN]\n- Exit survey feedback (if available): [SUMMARIZE KEY THEMES]\n\n**Business Context (last 60 days):**\n- Pricing/billing changes: [DESCRIBE]\n- Product/service changes: [DESCRIBE]\n- Competitor activity: [DESCRIBE]\n- Marketing campaigns: [DESCRIBE]\n- Operational issues: [DESCRIBE]\n- Economic/market factors: [DESCRIBE]\n\n**What I'm Trying to Determine:**\n1. What are the most likely root causes (rank by probability)?\n2. Which causes are within our control vs external?\n3. What data would prove or disprove each hypothesis?\n4. What quick wins could address the controllable causes?\n5. What should we monitor going forward?\n\nPlease structure your analysis using a hypothesis-driven approach. For each potential cause, explain the logic and what evidence would confirm it.",

      "Use hypothesis-driven structure (if X, then we'd expect Y)",

  "exampleOutput": "## Root Cause Analysis: December Retention Drop\n\n### Hypothesis 1: Price Increase Impact (75% confidence)\n**Logic:** Members renewing in Dec faced 5% higher prices for the first time. If price-sensitive, they may have chosen not to renew.\n\n**Expected evidence if true:**\n- Churn concentrated in renewal cohort (✓ confirmed: 60% were renewals)\n- Churn higher in price-sensitive segments\n- Exit surveys mention price/value\n\n**Controllable?** Partially - price is set, but we can adjust messaging, add value, or offer retention incentives.\n\n**Quick wins:**\n- Proactive outreach to Jan/Feb renewals with value messaging\n- Consider limited-time retention offer for at-risk accounts\n\n### Hypothesis 2: Competitor Discount Campaign (50% confidence)...",
